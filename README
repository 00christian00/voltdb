What is VoltDB?
====================
VoltDB is an in-memory online transaction processing (OLTP) database
designed from the ground up to be the fastest most scalable OLTP
system in the world.


What it is not?
===============
VoltDB is not a general purpose database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, for
example.


Getting Started
===============
'ant check'      Compile VoltDB and run all tests.

'ant doc'        Generate Javadoc in doc/java-api:

'ant dist'       Create a .tar.gz distribution with example apps
                 in obj/release/voltdb-version.tar.gz.

There are several example projects which can be compiled and run.  See
https://svn.voltdb.com/eng/trunk/examples/README for details.


Documentation
=============
Documentation on using VoltDB to build OLTP applications is available from the VoltDB community site at http://community.voltdb.com/downloads/


This content is available at https://svn.voltdb.com/eng/trunk/README.
