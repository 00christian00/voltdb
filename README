Thank you for your interest in VoltDB! The VoltDB project is managed at 
http://voltdb.com/.

What is VoltDB?
====================
VoltDB is an in-memory online transaction processing (OLTP) database
designed from the ground up to be the fastest most scalable OLTP
system in the world. VoltDB is distributed in a Community Edition 
(GPL3 license) and in an Enterprise Edition (commercial license). 
For difference between the two editions, see 
http://voltdb.com/content/voltdb-editions-and-pricing.


What VoltDB is not
==================
VoltDB is not a general purpose database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, for
example.


Binary Distributions
===============
Binary distributions of VoltDB Community Edition are available from the 
VoltDB community site at http://community.voltdb.com/downloads. 


Getting Started Building VoltDB from Source
============================================
'ant check'      Compile VoltDB and run all tests.

'ant doc'        Generate Javadoc in doc/java-api:

'ant dist'       Create a .tar.gz distribution with example apps
                 in obj/release/voltdb-version.tar.gz.

There are several example projects which can be compiled and run.  See
https://svn.voltdb.com/eng/trunk/examples/README for details.
