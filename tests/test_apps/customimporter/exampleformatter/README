Note:
    This package was created as part of ENG-9854. I've updated the code
    here to correspond to product changes since then.

This package contains a simple example of a formatter bundle.
The contents are as follows:

        lib directory - This directory is for including library jars for the formatter
                        bundle, at a bare minimum this must include a voltdb jar file and
                        OSGI library jar (org.osgi.framework)

        src directory - This directory is for the java source files which must have a formatter
                        source file which implements Formatter<T> where T is the type of the data
                        that comes to the importer, and a formatter factory source file which builds
                        the formatter and extends AbstractFormatterFactory.

        build.xml - This file is used to build the OSGI bundle using ant, it contains the following tasks:
                        build     - This is the default task and preforms the tasks clean -> dist -> formatter.
                        clean     - Removes the class file directory and the bundle jar.
                        dist      - Builds the class files in the directory obj.
                        formatter - Builds the OSGI bundle jar.

To include a custom formatter place the OSGI bundle into the VoltDB bundles folder ($VOLTHOME/bundles/),
in the deployment file the custom formatter jar is specified in the importer configuration and must also specify
the name of the formatter to use (formatName). To specify properties for the formatter use the tag <format-property>
and these must be placed after the importer properties.

For example:
<deployment>
    <cluster hostcount="1" kfactor="0"/>
    <httpd enabled="true">
        <jsonapi enabled="true" />
    </httpd>
    <import>
        <configuration module="socketstream.jar" type="custom" enabled="true" format="exampleformatter.jar/formatName">
            <property name="port">7072</property>
            <property name="procedure">EXAMPLE.insert</property>
            <format-property name="example">example</format-property>
        </configuration>
    </import>
</deployment>
