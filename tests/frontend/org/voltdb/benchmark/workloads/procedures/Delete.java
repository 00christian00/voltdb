/** A VoltDB stored procedure is a Java class defining one or
 * more SQL statements and implementing a <code>public
 * VoltTable[] run</code> method. VoltDB requires a
 * <code>ProcInfo</code> annotation providing metadata for the
 * procedure.  The <code>run</code> method is
 * defined to accept one or more parameters. These parameters take the
 * values the client passes via the
 * <code>VoltClient.callProcedure</code> invocation.
 *
 * <a
 * href="https://hzproject.com/svn/repos/doc/trunk/Stored%20Procedure%20API.docx">Stored
 * Procedure API</a> specifies valid stored procedure definitions,
 * including valid run method parameter types, required annotation
 * metadata, and correct use the Volt query interface.
