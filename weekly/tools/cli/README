Prototype VoltDB Command Line Interface (CLI)

To use the VoltDB CLI:

1. Compile the cli:  

   $ javac VoltdbCli

2. Define the environment variable VOLTDBROOT to point to where VoltDB is installed. For example:

   $ export VOLTDBROOT=$HOME/voltdb-0.5.02/

3. Make sure classpath is defined to include Volt and the location of the CLI (in this case, the /tools/ subfolder):

   $ export CLASSPATH=./:$VOLTDBROOT/voltdb/*:$VOLTDBROOT/tools/

4. Define voltdb as an alias to invoke the CLI:

   $ alias voltdb='java VoltDBCli'

Once you have performed the preceding steps (you can put steps 2-4 into your .bashrc file so they are executed automatically when you login), you can start using the CLI. There are two ways to invoke the CLI:

   $ voltdb
   $ voltdb {command}

If you start voltdb without an argument, it starts a command line parser. You can then issue VoltDB commands until you explicitly EXIT the CLI. 

If you invoke voltdb with a command, it executes the command and then returns you to the shell.

See voltdb HELP for information about the commands you can use.
