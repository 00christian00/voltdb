Example Projects
================
The following projects are included in the examples directory:

auction
  This example contains a set of schema, clients, and procedures for running auction related transactions. 

helloworld
  This directory contains the sources for the "Hello World" tutorial from the book Getting Started With VoltDB.

key_value
  This directory contains the sources for the "Key-Value" implementation in VoltDB.

satellite
  This example is a simulation of satellite tracking.

voter
  This example is a simulation of a telephone based voting process where callers are allowed a limited number of votes.


Each example includes a DDL file and a project.xml that lists the DDL file and the stored procedures names. The auction, satellite, and voter examples also include an Ant build file. (Helloworld is the exception. See the README in the helloworld folder for an explanation of how to build that example.)

The command "ant -p" will print a description of the available targets for each example. The targets "client" and "server" let you  run a client and server for each example. (The satellite example contains the additional target "tracker".)

To run an example project, from within the examples/example_of_choice directory:
- In a terminal window, run ant (no target) to compile the Java and example catalog
- Run ant server, to start the VoltDB server
- In a separate terminal window, run ant client, where you will see the results
- When complete, hit Ctrl C in the server terminal window to stop the VoltDB database

See the README file in each example directory for more details.
