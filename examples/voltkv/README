Key-Value application
===========================

This example application demonstrates how to create a "Key-Value" store in VoltDB.

Many attributes of the application are customizable through arguments passed to the client, including:

  - The maximum number of transactions the client will attempt per second
  - How long the sample client runs
  - When to start recording performance statistics
  - How frequently to report those statistics
  - "Key" size
  - Minimum and Maximum "Value" size (Value sizes will be randomly distributed between min and max)
  - Percentage of transactions that are "Gets" (out of 100%, the rest are "Puts")
  - Store the "Value" as is (text), Base64 encode the "Value" (uncompressible binary), or Compress/Base64 encode the "Value" (compressible binary)

These attributes can be adjusted by modifying the arguments to the "client" and "client-threaded" targets in the makefile.

Additional arguments allow the client to automatically "tune" itself for optimal performance ("client" target only).

  - Whether auto-tuning should be turned on, allowing the benchmark to determine an optimal TPS for a given target latency
  - Target average transaction call latency (in milliseconds)
  - Adjustment rate: the tuning process decreases the number of requested transactions per second to FACTOR*<observed-TPS> until the target latency is reached
  - Auto-tuning interval (in seconds)

While this example application demonstrates how to implement a Key-Value system using VoltDB, it also implements the following:

Measuring Performance - Client Network Bandwidth
------------------------------------------------

The "Voter" example application implemented extended benchmark display.  Key-Value also displays the amount of client network bandwidth (MB in and out).


Logging
------------------------------------------------

This application supports logging using log4j and is delivered with log4j configuration files for both the client (log-client.xml) and server (log-server.xml).


Interpreting the Results
------------------------

The default client configuration will allow the system to automatically tune itself for optimal performance, regardless of your underlying hardware and cluster deployment.

The client starts "fire-hosing" the VoltDB server by attempting to submit transactions faster than the server can possibly process them (1 billion transactions per second, or 1B TPS).  Within 5 seconds, the automated tuning should be able to figure out an optimized throughput (TPS) that maintains transaction latency within 10 ms.

You can also turn Auto-Tuning off to experiment with different loads and better understand why proper tuning is key to getting the most of your specific VoltDB deployment.

Rate-limiting your clients (or adding cluster nodes) is essential to preventing "fire-hosing" your server (cluster) and will ensure you get proper application responsiveness (latency) while maximizing througput (TPS) for your hardware configuration.

While the "Key-Value" application is designed with benchmarking in mind, it is essentially a network-bound application: you will generally find that you max-out your network bandwidth long before you reach "impressive" pure database throughput (TPS) numbers.

For a better feel for the type of performance VoltDB is capable of on your hardware, check out the "Voter" application sample.

Multi-Threaded Client
------------------------

We have included a multi-threaded client (ClientThreadedKV.java) that creates a pool of threads to perform the compression and Base64 encoding (and Base64 decoding and decompression).


make targets described
---------------------

make                   : compile all Java clients and stored procedures, build the catalog, and start the server

make server            : start the server

make client            : start the client, [if needed, initialize the given number of key-value pairs (puts),] begin normal client processing (gets and puts)

make client-threaded   : start the multi-threaded client, [if needed, initialize the given number of key-value pairs (puts),] begin normal client processing (gets and puts)

make catalog           : compile sources and build the catalog

make clean             : remove compiled files
