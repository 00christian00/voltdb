The satellite example is a simulation of satellite tracking. The example contains two client applications:

- signal.Client - Simulates a data collector, pushing location information into the database with 0.1 second delays
- tracker.UserInterface - Simulates a tracker, that queries to database every 3 seconds and graphically shows where the satellites are on a world map.

The easiest way to run the example is to use ant to build and run the application. You will need three terminal windows:

- In window #1, run "ant" and "ant server"
- In window #2. run "ant client"
- In window #3, run "ant tracker"

The "server" target creates the database. The "client" target runs the signal client, pretending to send location information for 5 satellites (by default). The "tracker" client displays a window trakcing the location of the satellites.

It is also possible to run multiple signal clients, so you can demonstrate in real-time that the tracker is pulling data out of the database (as new satellites appear on the map). To customize the signal.Client, you can specify the number of satellites it simulates and their country of origin:

	java signal.Client <n> <country>

Where <n> is any positive integer and <country> is one of the following: brazil, china, france, india, or usa.

NOTE: You must set your CLASSPATH prior to executing the above command (such as "export CLASSPATH=.:../../voltdb/").
