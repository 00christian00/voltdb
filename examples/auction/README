The auction example is a VERY simple on-line auction simulation.

The auction-ddl.sql file describes the following tables:
- Category (types of things that can be auctioned)
- Item (actual things that are auctioned)
- User (buyers and sellers)
- Auction (one record per auction, including a start time equal to the creation time of the record and an end time 2 minutes later)
- Bid (all of the bids for all of the auctions)

A client is provided that runs various Java stored procedure files to:
- Load categories, users, and items from the category,txt, user.txt, and item.txt datafiles into the appropriate tables.
- Load 4 auctions from the auctions.txt file into the auction table and initiate the auctions.
- Provide bids by various users for each auction, using an algorithm for creating a new bid price based on the previous bid for the item adjusted by an increase based on the starting price and a random Gaussian function. Each auction completes within 1 to 2 minutes after the auction starts. 
- Provide periodic status on each auction.
- Provide the results of each auction after close.

Export
------
The auction example is also set up to demonstrate the ability for VoltDB to export live data from a running database. To run the auction example with export enabled, you must do the following:

1. Edit project.xml and change enabled="false" to enabled="true" in the <connector> tag.

2. Start three terminal windows.

3. In the first terminal window, issue the "ant server" command to start the auction database server.

4. In the second terminal window, issue the "ant export" command to start the export receiver.

5. In the third terminal window, issue the "ant client" command to start the auction client application.

When you perform these actions, the auction client will run as usual. At the same time, the export receiver will write all of the BID and ITEM records to comma-separated files in the default directory.

When the auction example finishes running CTRL-C in the server window and the server and export receiver processes will stop.
