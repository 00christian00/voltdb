VoltCounter application
===========================

This example demonstrates fast counters functionality. Similar to rainbird (Tweeter) which uses cassandra for counting or tracking verious counters.

Many attributes of the application are customizable through arguments passed to the client, including:

  - Numbers of counters
  - How deep the group of counters be.
  - How long the sample client runs
  - The maximum number of transactions the client will attempt per second
  - When to start recording performance statistics
  - How frequently to report those statistics

These attributes can be adjusted by modifying the arguments to the "client" target in run.sh.

Additional arguments allow the client to automatically tune itself for optimal performance

  - Whether auto-tuning should be turned on, allowing the benchmark to determine an optimal TPS for a given target latency
  - Target average stored procedure call (SPC) latency (in ms)
