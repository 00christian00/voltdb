Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This example application implements Conway's Game of Life.  It includes a client to evolve the grid and another client to display the grid.

Many attributes of the application are customizable through arguments passed to the client, including: 

  - The number of rows in the grid.
  - The number of columns in the grid.
  - The initial number of cells.

These attributes can be adjusted by modifying the arguments to the "client" target in the Ant build script. 

Additionally, a second client target "gui" will display the live grid.
