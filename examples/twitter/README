Twitter application
===================

This example application uses the Twitter API to monitor a stream of tweets and parse out hashtags. Hashtag trends are calculated and made available via a web interface.

Many attributes of the application are customizable through arguments passed to the client, including:

  - The twitter login username (-DTwitterUsername).
  - The twitter login password (-DTwitterPassword).
  - The local web server port.
  - The number of hash tags to show in each table.

These attributes can be adjusted by modifying the arguments to the "client" target in the Ant build script.

  *** Note *** that you MUST change the username and password to your own valid credentials for this application to work.

Additionally, a second client target "cull" can be run that will periodically delete old hashtags. This too has customizable parameters:

  - The retention range in hours.
  - The frequency with which to perform the delete in hours.
