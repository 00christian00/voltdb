# TO-DO List for New Volt CLI

* Daemon process management for servers.
* Follow Andrew's CLI proposal more closely, e.g. separate sql to its own
  command and rename volt to voltdb.
* Aliases for commands plus arguments.
* Use cfg file as an easier way to define new commands (for full run.sh
  replacement), e.g. as aliases. Not sure this is practical.
* Interactive shell with command recall and auto-completion.
* Log tailing (with colorizing).
