# The VoltDB master command script
#
# The main script's primary responsibility is to configure the system path so that
# the voltcli library can take care of everything else. In the future this script
# could be generated during installation. The interesting logic should live
# elsewhere.
#
# Note that this script can be copied to other locations and file names to
# support additional main commands that use their own <name>.d directories for
# command modules and <name>*.cfg configuration files. The voltcli library
# directory is located by searching up the directory hierarchy for one of the
# following paths:
#   <dir>/vcli_run.py
#   <dir>/voltcli/vcli_run.py
#   <dir>/lib/voltcli/vcli_run.py.
#
# Environment Variables
#   JAVA_HOME          The java implementation to use.  Overrides JAVA_HOME.
#   JAVA_HEAP_MAX      The maximum amount of heap to use, in MB. Default is 1024.
#   VOLTDB_OPTS        Extra Java runtime options.
#   LOG4J_CONFIG_PATH  Path to alternate log4j configuration
